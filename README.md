## Getting started 🚀

- `git clone https://github.com/Datlyfe/jira_clone.git`
- Install [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) if you don't have it already and create a database ( there is also a docker compose file if you prefer using docker, just run `docker-compose up` inside the backend folder)
- Create an empty `.env` file in `/backend`, copy `/backend/.env.example` contents into it, and fill in your database username and password.
- `npm run install-deps`
- `npm run start:back`
- `npm run start:front` in another terminal tab
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:8080/`

## Inspiration and Why? 🤷‍♀️

I'm a Full Stack Web developer and an open source collaborator that loves building things 😉

This project is basically a clone of another open source Jira clone build in React ( clone of a clone i know 😵) and since im a Vuejs lover i had the idea of rebuilding the app with the same functionalities but using Vuejs instead as i though it would be a great opportunity to explore the new composition api coming to Vue very soon. and since we are doing a full rewrite i added Graphql and Typescript to the mix.

I belive that this project will be a great example for Vuejs developers in the future transitioning from the old Vuejs Api to the new composition Api or for Vuejs newcomers in general.
